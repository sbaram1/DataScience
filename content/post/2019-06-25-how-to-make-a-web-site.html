<p>RStudio</p>
<ul>
<li>make a new project</li>
<li>blogdown::serve_site()</li>
</ul>
<p>To start a new website:</p>
<p>Carefully pick a theme at <a href="http://themes.gohugo.io" class="uri">http://themes.gohugo.io</a>, and find the link to its GitHub repository, which is of the form <a href="https://github.com/user/repo" class="uri">https://github.com/user/repo</a>.</p>
<p>Create a new project in RStudio, and type the code blogdown::new_site(theme = ‘user/repo’) in the R console, where user/repo is from the link in Step 1.</p>
<p>Play with the new site for a while and if you do not like it, you can repeat the above steps, otherwise edit the options in config.toml. If you do not understand certain options, go to the documentation of the theme, which is often the README page of the GitHub repository. Not all options have to be changed.</p>
<p>To edit a website:</p>
<p>Click the RStudio addin “Serve Site” to preview the site in RStudio Viewer. This only needs to be done once every time you open the RStudio project or restart your R session. Do not click the Knit button on the RStudio toolbar.</p>
<p>Use the “New Post” addin to create a new post or page, then start writing the content.</p>
<p>Use the “Update Metadata” addin to modify the YAML metadata if necessary.</p>
<p>To publish a website if you are not familiar with GIT or GitHub:</p>
<p>Restart the R session, and run blogdown::hugo_build(). You should get a public/ directory under the root directory of your project.</p>
<p>Log into <a href="https://www.netlify.com" class="uri">https://www.netlify.com</a> (you can use a GitHub account if you have one). If this is the first time you have published this website, you can create a new site, otherwise you may update the existing site you created last time. You can drag and drop the public/ folder from your file viewer to the indicated area on the Netlify web page, where it says “Drag a folder with a static site here.”</p>
<p>Wait for a few seconds for Netlify to deploy the files, and it will assign a random subdomain of the form random-word-12345.netlify.com to you. You can (and should) change this random subdomain to a more meaningful one if it is still available.</p>
<p>It can be much easier to publish a website if you are familiar with GIT and GitHub. We recommend that you create a new site on Netlify from your GitHub repository that contains the source files of your website, so that you can enjoy the benefits of continuous deployment instead of manually uploading the public/ folder every time. With this approach, you do not need to run blogdown::hugo_build() locally, because the website can be built on Netlify via Hugo. See Chapter 3 for more information.</p>
