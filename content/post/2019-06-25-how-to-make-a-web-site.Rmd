To start a new website:

  - prn> pick a theme at http://themes.gohugo.io, and find the link to its GitHub repository, which is of the form https://github.com/user/repo.
  
RStudio

  - make a new project
  - blogdown::new_site(theme = 'user/repo')
  - blogdown::serve_site()


To edit a website:

  - Use the “New Post” addin to create a new post or page
  - Use the “Update Metadata” addin to modify the YAML metadata if necessary.

To publish a website if you are not familiar with GIT or GitHub:

  - Restart the R session, and run blogdown::hugo_build()
  - You should get a public/ directory under the root directory of your project.
  
  - Log into https://www.netlify.com (you can use a GitHub account if you have one). 
  - from your GitHub repository

  - You can (and should) change this random subdomain to a more meaningful one if it is still available.

Global option settting:

  - file.edit("~/.Rprofile")
  - options(blogdown.ext = ".Rmd", blogdown.author = "John Doe")
